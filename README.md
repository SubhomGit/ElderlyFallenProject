Introduction:
Falls among elderly individuals can lead to severe injuries or fatalities if not promptly attended to. With an increasing number of elderly people living alone, there is a critical need for automated systems that can detect falls and alert caregivers immediately. This project leverages computer vision and modern communication technologies to enhance the safety and well-being of elderly individuals.
Technical Approach: 
Video Capture and Preprocessing:
Use a webcam to capture live video streams.
Preprocess video frames by resizing and converting them to grayscale for faster processing.

Person Detection:
Implement the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to detect persons in video frames.

Fall Detection Algorithm:
Analyze bounding boxes of detected persons to determine if a fall has occurred based on a significant reduction in height.

SMS Alert System:
Configure an email-to-SMS gateway to send alert messages to caregivers when a fall is detected.

Methodology:
Setup and Configuration: Install necessary Python libraries (opencv-python, numpy, imutils, smtplib). Configure email account with an application-specific password for sending alerts.

Person Detection: Use pre-trained HOG + SVM model to detect persons.

Fall Detection: Track bounding boxes of detected persons across frames and identify falls based on height changes.

SMS Alerts: Use Python's smtplib to send emails via SMTP, configured to send as SMS using the recipient's phone number and carrier domain.

HOG + SVM for Object Detection
The combination of HOG and SVM is a popular approach for object detection tasks, such as detecting pedestrians in images. Here's how they work together:

Feature Extraction using HOG:
The HOG descriptor is applied to an image to extract features representing the appearance of objects within localized regions.
The result is a feature vector that captures the gradient structure of the image.

Classification using SVM:
The extracted HOG feature vectors are fed into an SVM classifier.
The SVM classifier is trained on labeled data to learn the optimal hyperplane that separates the object (e.g., pedestrians) from the background or other objects.
During detection, the SVM classifier predicts whether a given region in a new image contains the target object based on the HOG features.
This combination is effective because HOG captures important visual characteristics of objects, while SVM provides a robust mechanism for classification based on those features.
